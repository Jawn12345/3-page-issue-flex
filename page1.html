        <h2>About Sea Turtles</h2></div>
        <p>Sea turtles are an ancient species, dating back to about 220 million years
          ago. These ancient animals have lived in our waters since the time of the
          dinosaurs. Their average lifespan is about 30 to 100 years, but the upper
          limits are still unknowned to scientists. There are 7 different species of
          sea turtles living in the world today, and they are the Leatherback, Green,
          Hawksbill, Loggerhead, Olive Ridly, Kemp's Ridley, and Flatback.
          </p>
        <p>Sea turtles are characterized by their shell and non-retractile head and
          limbs, meaning that they cannot put their heads and limbs inside their shell.
          The top part of their shell is called the carapace while the bottom part
          is called a plastrong. Most species of sea turtles, except the green turtle,
          are omnivorous. Some species of sea turtles specializes on a certain prey.
          For example, Hawksbill Sea Turtles primarily eat sea sponges and Leatherback
          Sea Turtles eat jellyfishes and sea squirts.

        <p>Sea turtles live most of their lives in the sea; however, they periodic
          come ashore to lay their eggs. Sea turtles have the ability of magnetoreception,
          or the ability to detect the Earth's magnetic field. They use this ability
          to help them return to their nesting grounds to lay their eggs. Like many
          species of reptiles, the temperature of the developing eggs is what ultimately
          determines the sex of the offspring. Higher temperatures produce more female
          offsprings while lower temperatures produce more male offsprings. After eggs
          hatch, baby sea turtles have to make a mad dash to ocean at night, avoiding predators
          such as birds and crabs. They have the tendency to move in the brightest
          direction, which is typically the moonlight reflected over the ocean.

        <h2>What is happening to Sea Turtles</h2> </div>
        <p>Out of the 7 species of sea turtles, nearly all of them are classified as
          endangered or vulnerable species, with 2 of them being critically endangered.
          The 2 endangered species are the Hawksbill and the Kemp's Ridley. There are
          numerous reasons for the significant decline in sea turtle population. These
          include bycatch, light pollution, poaching, habitat destruction, platic waste,
          and more.
          </p>
        <p>Plastic is often mistaken as jellyfish or species of sea algae, causing
          the niche that the sea turtles have carved out for themselves to become
          a major detriment. Roughly a quarter of the sea turtles that have ingested
          just one plastic bag have died. Even if the sea turtle survives the experience
          they are, often, adverse side effects.
          </p>
        <p>Artificial light sources, especially near the beach confuses newly hatched
          sea turtles. Instead of following the light towards the ocean, they follow
          the light away from the beach, and onto roads and lawns. This is one of the
          reasons why many conservationists gather at beaches during hatching season in
          order to ensure that the sea turtles are heading the right way.
          </p>
        <p>As a result of global warming, sea turtles are undergoing a sex inbalance
          problem right now. If the temperature continues to rise, only females sea
          turtles will be born. Furthermore, the rise in sea levels have begun eroding
          the beaches, the nesting grounds of sea turtles. </p>

          <h2>So what can you do?</h2> </div>
          <p>Decrease the use of plastics, in general, will help the environment, but
            especially for sea turtles who may confuse it as their snack. If you are
            living near the beachfront, turn off your lights at night to decrease
            the chances that baby sea turtles will get confused. Volunteering for
            plastic cleanup at beaches, assisting turtles in getting back to the sea are
            all ways you can help. The biggest component, however, is to pester the
            government and hold them accountable for the pollutions that are affecting
            the lives of many sea turtles and other marine species.
